Feature: As an administrator, I want to access the details of the Refund&Reason with the specified ID number via the
  API connection.

  Scenario Outline: When a GET request body containing valid authorization information and the refund&reason ID to access detailed
  information is sent to the /api/refundReasonDetails endpoint, the returned status code should be 200 and the
  message information in the response body should be verified as "success".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token.
    # APi kullanicisi "admin" token ile base urli olusturur
    * The api user sets "api/refundReasonDetails" path parameters
    # APi kullanicisi "api/refundReasonDetails" path parametrelerini olusturur
    * The api user prepares a GET request containing the refund reason <id> for which details are to be accessed, to send to the api refundReasonDetails endpoint.
    # Api kullanicisi api refundReasonDetails endpointine gondermek icin detaylarina erisilmek istenen refund reason idsini iceren bir get request hazirlar
    * The api user sends a GET request and saves the response returned from the api refundReasonDetails endpoint.

  refund&reason ID is sent to the /api/refundReasonDetails endpoint, the returned status code should be 404,
